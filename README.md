The name of this is called "NOTIFINDER".
Basically this is a GUI based Notification Remainder for Desktop.
It remainds you with a particular Title and Message on your Desktop on a given time. Moreover it also sends you a text message to your mobile on a given time.

Things need to do before using...
1. Run the following command in Command Prompt
   1.1 pip install tkinter
   1.2 pip install notifypy
   1.3 pip install datetime
   1.4 pip install twilio.rest
   1.5 pip install time
    
2. Change the directory of the attached files inside the code.

3. Change the values at mentioned places in code.


Note:  At the end don't tell it's not working. Because I don't like to tell that, "It was working perfectly on my computer!..."  :)
